== Basic installation

This software is published in the Python Package Index (PYPI), formerly
known as the Python Cheeseshop.  If you have the setuptools installed,
you may be able to install this module with just:

   easy_install demjson

Otherwise, you can install it by downloading the distrubtion and
unpacking it in some temporary directory.  Then inside that
directory, type:

    python setup.py install

Optionally, for a minimal installation, you can also just copy the
"demjson.py" file into your own project's directory.


== jsonlint command

You can optionally install the script jsonlint by copying it to
any directory on your PATH, such as into /usr/local/bin under
Unix/Linux.  Make sure the script is set as being executable.


== Running self tests

Self tests are included which conform to the Python unittest
framework.  To run these tests, do

    cd test
    PYTHONPATH=.. python test_demjson.py
